The project is made up of three sections

koh-api:
	This contains the API for KOH and is built on Mongo.
	It uses Express4 as the middleware and is set up to work with restangular

koh-frontend:
	This area contains all the front end code for the site


koh-frontend/test:
	This is where the front end tests written in Protractor reside
